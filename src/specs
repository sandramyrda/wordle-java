# Project: Wordle

## MVP

-   Recreate a simplified version of the game Wordle to be played in a Java console application
-   The game should be able to randomly select a 5-letter word from the provided word list
-   The user will be able to enter a guess word that is also 5 characters long
-   For each letter, the application will tell the user if that letter is correct, right letter in the wrong position, or wrong letter
-   After the user guesses 6 times incorrectly, the game is over and the user loses
-   If the user guesses the word correctly, the game is over and the user wins
-   In addition you must implement one of the following extensions, or an extension of your own design as approved by a coach

### Extensions

-   Read the word list directly from the file when the application starts
-   Create a history file that keeps track of user wins/losses and how many letters they guessed it in
-   When the game finishes and the secret word is shown, also display the dictionary definition for that word
    -   Hint: Use a free API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
-   Generate an output of the word/guesses and copy it to the user's clipboard so they can share it on socials
    -   Bonus: Use emojis

String emoji = new String(Character.toChars(0x25FB));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(inputArr));
System.out.println(guessWord.equals(input));
System.out.println(Arrays.asList(guessArr).contains(inputArr[0]));
